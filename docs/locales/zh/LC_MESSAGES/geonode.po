"GeoNode (http://geonode.org/) is a platform for the management and "
"publication of geospatial data. It brings together mature and stable "
"open-source software projects under a consistent and easy-to-use "
"interface allowing users, with little training, to quickly and easily "
"share data and create interactive maps. GeoNode provides a cost-effective"
" and scalable tool for developing information management systems.  "
"GeoNode uses CSW as a cataloguing mechanism to query and present "
"geospatial metadata."

"pycsw supports binding to an existing GeoNode repository for metadata "
"query.  The binding is read-only (transactions are not in scope, as "
"GeoNode manages repository metadata changes in the application proper)."
