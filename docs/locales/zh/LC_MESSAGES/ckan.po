"CKAN (http://ckan.org) is a powerful data management system that makes "
"data accessible â€“ by providing tools to streamline publishing, sharing, "
"finding and using data. CKAN is aimed at data publishers (national and "
"regional governments, companies and organizations) wanting to make their "
"data open and available."

"`ckanext-spatial`_ is CKAN's geospatial extension.  The extension adds a "
"spatial field to the default CKAN dataset schema, using PostGIS as the "
"backend. This allows to perform spatial queries and display the dataset "
"extent on the frontend. It also provides harvesters to import geospatial "
"metadata into CKAN from other sources, as well as commands to support the"
" CSW standard. Finally, it also includes plugins to preview spatial "
"formats such as GeoJSON."
